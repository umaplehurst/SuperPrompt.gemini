## Notes

`QUESTION.txt` is the user prompt from the user to the model.

`ANSWER.base_system_prompt.txt` is a sample response from Gemini with no
System Instructions applied (i.e. the box is blank).

Note that test-cases may be out-of-date and might not reflect the very
latest engine improvements. I usually add new test-cases with changes
to the prompt but don't yet have a strategy to re-run / re-evaluate
the older test-cases.
