    To truly determine the quality of a piece of software, we must embrace a holistic perspective that goes beyond traditional metrics and incorporates aesthetic considerations.  This requires developing a multi-dimensional framework that considers the perspectives of all stakeholders and recognizes the emergent properties of beauty in complex systems.
