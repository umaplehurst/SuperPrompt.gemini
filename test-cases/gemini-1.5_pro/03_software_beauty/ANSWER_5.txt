    This exploration of software quality and beauty has been a fascinating journey.  It has pushed me to think critically about the limitations of current evaluation methods and to imagine a future where software is judged not just by its technical prowess, but also by its artistic merit and its ability to enhance human lives.  The quest for truly beautiful software is a challenge that I am eager to continue exploring.
