How can we better understand why most people are continuing with BaU and not taking into consideration the ongoing and documented ecological collapse that overshoot is causing (resource exhaustion, pollution, global warming, ...)? Take into account this thought process:

A being a function: Expand in "Capitalism"
Expand(Everywhere, Now, Always) = Expand(X, t) + Δt(dA / dt)
Imagine X to be North / South America but realistically it's most of Earth's land-mass.
Δt = small unit time flow

It seems that: there would be no problems with the statement if territory to expand into is available in the current model, and my current observations say territory for expansion is not available and the model has no option, but to collapse or cannibalize.
