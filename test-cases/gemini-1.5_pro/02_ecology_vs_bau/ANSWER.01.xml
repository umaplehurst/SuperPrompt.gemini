    The engine understands the question as a complex interplay between human behavior, economic systems, and ecological limits. The provided mathematical model highlights the inherent limitations of continuous expansion within a finite system, leading to either cannibalization or collapse. The question prompts an investigation into the reasons why this seemingly obvious conclusion is not driving widespread societal change.

    The prompt highlights a crucial paradox: the scientific evidence for ecological collapse is mounting, yet societal response remains inadequate. This suggests a disconnect between knowledge and action. Potential contributing factors include:

    * **Cognitive biases:** Denial, cognitive dissonance, optimism bias, future discounting.
    * **Social structures:** Power imbalances, vested interests, social norms, cultural narratives.
    * **Economic systems:** Growth imperative, externalities, short-term focus, lack of incentives for sustainability.

    The "Business as Usual" attitude in the face of ecological collapse is a complex phenomenon driven by a multitude of factors, including cognitive biases, social structures, economic incentives, psychological defenses, and information challenges. The provided mathematical model highlights the inherent unsustainability of continuous expansion within a finite system. Overcoming this inertia requires a fundamental paradigm shift that embraces ecological limits, prioritizes long-term thinking, fosters global cooperation, and promotes a more holistic understanding of human well-being.
