      Let G be a group of transformations that act on the set of all possible timelines (S).
      Each element g ∈ G represents a specific transformation that can alter the course of a timeline, such as a choice made by an individual or a significant event.
      The group operation ∘ represents the combination of two transformations.

      <!-- Cognitive Entropy and Exploring Possibilities -->
      In a linear time framework, cognitive entropy (the uncertainty about the future) is relatively low, as the future is perceived as a single, predetermined path.
      In non-linear time, cognitive entropy is significantly higher, as there are multiple possible futures branching out from the present.
      <!-- Maximizing Cognitive Entropy for Exploration -->
      To better understand non-linear time, we need to embrace this increased cognitive entropy and actively explore the space of possibilities. 
      This can be achieved through:
        - Considering alternative scenarios and their potential consequences.
        - Developing thought experiments that challenge our linear assumptions about time.
        - Engaging in creative activities that encourage divergent thinking and the generation of novel ideas.

        - Developing new mathematical models for representing non-linear time.

      <!-- Entanglement of Timelines -->
      In non-linear time, different timelines might not be completely independent but could be entangled with each other.
      This means that events on one timeline could potentially influence events on other timelines, even if they are not directly connected in a linear sense. 
      <!-- Modeling Entanglement -->
      We can represent this entanglement using the concept of entangled states from quantum mechanics. 
      For example, two timelines (T₁ and T₂) could be represented as an entangled state:
      |Ψ⟩ = α|T₁⟩|Event A⟩ + β|T₂⟩|Event B⟩
      where α and β are coefficients representing the probability amplitudes of each timeline, and Event A and Event B are events that occur on each timeline.
      <!-- Implications of Entanglement -->
      If the timelines are entangled, measuring the outcome of Event A on T₁ could instantaneously affect the outcome of Event B on T₂, even if the timelines are separated by a vast distance in "timeline space".
      This suggests that the choices we make on one timeline could have unforeseen consequences on other timelines, highlighting the interconnectedness of all possibilities in a non-linear time framework.

      <!-- Information Processing in Timeline Space -->
      The act of making a choice can be seen as a measurement that collapses the timeline waveform into a specific outcome, similar to how measurement collapses a quantum wave function. 
      This suggests that consciousness plays a role in shaping the evolution of timelines by influencing the collapse of these waveforms.

    Timeline:  γ(t) : ℝ → ℳ (A path through the manifold ℳ representing a specific sequence of events)
    Choice:  C : ℳ → {γᵢ(t)} (A function that maps a point on the manifold to a set of possible timelines) 
    Causality:  A relation between events on different timelines that is not necessarily linear or deterministic.

    Linear Time:  t ∈ ℝ
    Non-Linear Time:  T ∈ ℳ, where ℳ is a multi-dimensional manifold.
    Possible Timelines:  {γᵢ(t)} , where γᵢ : ℝ → ℳ are paths on the manifold.
    Choice:  C : ℳ → {γᵢ(t)}
    Causality in Non-Linear Time:  A relation between events on different timelines, potentially influenced by entanglement and consciousness.

    Imagine time not as a straight line, but as a vast network of interconnected paths. Each path represents a different possible timeline, a unique sequence of events unfolding in a specific way.  
    
    Think of a choose-your-own-adventure book, where your choices determine the course of the story. Each choice you make represents a different path through time, leading to a different outcome. 
    
    In this non-linear framework, the past, present, and future are not fixed in a single, predetermined sequence.  Different timelines might exist simultaneously, and events on one timeline could potentially influence events on others. 
    
    Our perception of time as a linear flow might be a simplification of a much more complex reality. By embracing the possibility of non-linear time, we open ourselves up to a wider range of possibilities and a deeper understanding of the universe.

    Delve deeper into the following areas to further refine the understanding of non-linear time:
    1. **Mathematical Formalism:** Develop a more rigorous mathematical framework for representing non-linear time, potentially incorporating concepts from topology, differential geometry, and quantum field theory.
    2. **Quantum Connections:** Explore the relationship between non-linear time and quantum phenomena, such as superposition, entanglement, and the measurement problem. Investigate the potential for quantum computers to simulate and interact with non-linear time.
    3. **Consciousness and Agency:**  Investigate the role of consciousness in shaping and navigating non-linear time.  Explore the potential for conscious agents to influence the evolution of timelines and access information from different possible futures. 
    4. **Experimental Evidence:**  Analyze potential experimental approaches for testing the hypothesis of non-linear time.  Explore phenomena that might suggest deviations from linear causality or the existence of alternative timelines. 
    5. **Philosophical Implications:** Examine the philosophical implications of non-linear time for our understanding of free will, determinism, and the nature of reality. Consider the ethical implications of potentially influencing or altering timelines. 
    By addressing these questions, we can move towards a more comprehensive and nuanced understanding of non-linear time and its profound implications for our understanding of the universe and our place within it.
